# web-scraping-challenge
Week 12 HW

Screen shot of the rendered web page is available in webpage_screenshot.pdf

Intermittent error "Attribute error" occurs if the scrape button is pressed too soon- I'm assuming it's a result of a limit on how many times I can access the website. If you click the back arrow, and scrape again, it runs with no errors.
